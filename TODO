# TODO LIST
- Make a FSM of both Master & Slave

## TODO in General
- Be able to send messages between master and slave
    - Master should recognize the slave to send and receive messages
    - Messages Master to Slave
        - INIT: WHEN SENDING AMOUNT OF PIECES TO START WORKING TO SLAVES
        - ACK: WHEN A SLAVE MESSAGE IS RECEIVED (VERIFY IF NEEDED)
        - ABORT: WHEN ABORTING THE ACTUAL MANUFACTUAL PROCESS
    - Messages Slave to Master
        - STARTING
        - FINISHED
        - MALFUNCTION / ABORT
        - PIECES: MESSAGE CONTAINING UPDATE OF ITS STATE TO MASTER

- When a slave is dis/connected, master should indicate it with a pop-up
- Every node should have a local log
    - Master should point:
        - Slave connections
        - Orders scanned
        - Pieces update
        - Finished orders
        - Aborted orders
    - Slave should point:
        - Received amounts
        - Amount counter
        - Timers when pieces are finished/Aborted/malfunction
        - Connections
        - Crashes and the machine state
- Every node should persist in JSON
    - Master node should persist
        - IDs of the orders to match
        - The general state of the order and the actual counters of the slaves
    - Slave node should persist
        - ID of the orders to match, in case of consensus problem, the slave has always the correct value
        - The specific state of the order
- The master node should connect to the cloud and send the data whenver it finishes.
- All nodes should have open the SSH port using a SHA password
- A Kibana/Grafana Dashboard should be displayed
- Master should be able to read via keyboard the ID and then the content of the order
    - That data should be parsed into orders for the different machines to select
